Hi there, I'm a skilled and motivated software developer that specializes in back-end work. My area of expertise is creating scalable, performant, and well-architected APIs with Python and the Django REST Framework. My area of expertise is SQL, and I'm most excited about creating and optimizing databases.

To keep up with the field and provide the best results, I am always in the process of researching modern technologies and possible tools to improve my expertise. No matter whether I am creating APIs from scratch, or working with third-party services, or dealing with the database complexities, I always try to create clean code that will be easy to maintain and functional at the same time to help users and business alike.

Feel free to check out my repositories, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to collaborate on a project or discuss anything tech-related!
